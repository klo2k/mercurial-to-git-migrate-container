# Migrate Mercurial (HG) to Git repository directly between remotes

Container to migrate from Mercurial repository into Git repository, directly between remotes via Docker container.

```text
Mercurial --pull--> [This Container] --push--> Git
```

I developed this for my own use case but thought I'd share this.

**Please test this yourself first** - I hacked this up in a day so use at your own risk ðŸ˜‰ .

## Dependencies

Basically a recent version of `docker` and `docker-compose` - developed with these:

- Docker >= 20.10.12
- docker-compose >= 1.29.2

## Usage

1. Create your needs-specific `docker-compose.yml` (See [docker-compose.yml.template](./docker-compose.yml.template) for help)

    ```bash
    # Make a copy from template
    cp docker-compose.yml.template docker-compose.yml

    # Edit it to your needs
    vim docker-compose.yml
    ```

2. Run the migration container:

    ```bash
    ./run-hg-git-migration.sh
    ```

3. Profit ðŸ˜‹

## To Develop

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` (see above)
2. Run this in special debug mode

    ```bash
    ./run-hg-git-migration.sh development
    ```

3. Get shell into container

    ```bash
    ./bash_shell-hg-git-migration.sh
    ```
